The Monty Hall paradox reveals that changing doors does not give you a 50% (1/2) chance of winning, as most people intuitively think. Instead, changing doors gives you a 2/3 (66.7%) chance of winning, while sticking with your original choice leaves you with only a 1/3 (33.3%) chance.

This is because, when you first choose a door, there’s a 1/3 chance you picked the car and a 2/3 chance you picked a goat. When the host reveals a goat behind one of the other doors, switching allows you to capitalize on the 2/3 probability that the car wasn’t behind your first choice. So, switching is always the better strategy!
